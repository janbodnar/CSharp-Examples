# C# strings

A string in C# represents a sequence of characters encoded using UTF-16.  
It is a fundamental data type that stores a series of characters according  
to a specific character encoding. When a string appears directly in source  
code, it is referred to as a *string literal*.

In C#, strings are objects, and there are two primary classes available  
for handling them:

- `System.String`
- `System.Text.StringBuilder`

The `System.String` class provides immutable strings, meaning that once  
created, their content cannot be altered. On the other hand, the  
`System.Text.StringBuilder` class is designed for mutable strings,  
enabling efficient modifications like appending or replacing characters.

In C#, the `string` keyword is an alias for `System.String`. While  
`string` is specific to the C# language, `System.String` belongs to the  
.NET framework, and the two can be used interchangeably.

**Note:** This article focuses on basic ASCII strings. Working with  
strings in other alphabets, such as those with complex encodings, often  
involves more advanced operations.

## C# string initialization

There are multiple ways of creating strings, both immutable and mutable.  
We show a few of them.



```csharp
using System.Text;

char[] cdb = ['M', 'y', 'S', 'q', 'l'];

string lang = "C#";
string ide = "NetBeans";
string db = new(cdb);

Console.WriteLine(lang);
Console.WriteLine(ide);
Console.WriteLine(db);

var sb1 = new StringBuilder(lang);
var sb2 = new StringBuilder();

sb2.Append("Fields");
sb2.Append(" of ");
sb2.Append("glory");

Console.WriteLine(sb1);
Console.WriteLine(sb2);
```

The example shows a few ways of creating `System.String` and  
`System.Text.StringBuilder` objects.

This statement enables to use the `System.Text.StringBuilder` type  
without qualification.

```csharp
using System.Text;
```

The most common way is to create a string object from a string literal.

```csharp
string lang = "C#";
string ide = "NetBeans";
```

Here we create a string object from an array of characters. The `string`  
is an alias for the `System.String`.

```csharp
string db = new(cdb);
```

A `StringBuilder` object is created from a `String`.

```csharp
var sb1 = new StringBuilder(lang);
```

We create an empty `StringBuilder` object. We append three strings into  
the object.

```csharp
var sb2 = new StringBuilder();

sb2.Append("Fields");
sb2.Append(" of ");
sb2.Append("glory");
```

```
$ dotnet run
C#
NetBeans
MySql
C#
Fields of glory
```

## C# string interpolation

The $ special character prefix identifies a string literal as an  
interpolated string. An interpolated string is a string literal that  
might contain interpolated expressions.

String formatting is a similar feature to string interpolation; it is  
covered later in the chapter.



```csharp
int age = 23;
string name = "Peter";

DateTime now = DateTime.Now;

Console.WriteLine($"{name} is {age} years old");
Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Today is {now.DayOfWeek}, it's {now:HH:mm} now");
```

The example presents C# string interpolation.

The interpolated variables are placed between {} brackets.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"{name} is {age} years old");
```

The interpolation syntax can receive expressions or formatting specifiers.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Today is {now.DayOfWeek}, it's {now:HH:mm} now");
```

```
$ dotnet run
Peter is 23 years old
Hello, Peter! Today is Friday, it's 12:23 now
```

## C# regular string

Regular strings can contain escape sequences, such as new line or tab  
character, which are interpreted. Regular strings are placed between a  
pair of double quotes.



```csharp
string s1 = "deep \t forest";
string s2 = "deep \n forest";

Console.WriteLine(s1);
Console.WriteLine(s2);

Console.WriteLine("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents");
```

The example prints two strings which contain `\t` and `\n` escape  
sequences.

When working with e.g. paths, the slashes must be escaped.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents");
```

```
$ dotnet run
deep     forest
deep
    forest
C:\Users\Admin\Documents
```

## C# verbatim string

Verbatim strings do not interprete escape sequences. Verbatim strings are  
preceded with the `@` character. Verbatim strings can be used to work  
with multiline strings.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine(@"deep \t forest");
Console.WriteLine(@"C:\Users\Admin\Documents");

var text = @"
    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.";

Console.WriteLine(text);
```

In this code example we work with verbatim strings.

The `\t` special character is not interpreted; it is only printed to the  
console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(@"deep \t forest");
```

Verbatim strings are convenient when we work with paths; the shashes do  
not have to be escaped.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(@"C:\Users\Admin\Documents");
```

Verbatim strings allow us to create multiline strings.

```csharp
var text = @"
    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.";
```

```
$ dotnet run
deep \t forest
C:\Users\Admin\Documents

    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
```

## C# strings are objects

Strings are objects. They are reference types. Strings are instances of  
the `System.String` or `System.Text.StringBuilder` class. Since they are  
objects, they have multiple methods available for doing various work.



```csharp
string lang = "Java";
string bclass = lang.GetType().Name;
Console.WriteLine(bclass);

string parclass = lang.GetType().BaseType!.Name;
Console.WriteLine(parclass);

if (lang.Equals(string.Empty))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The string is empty");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The string is not empty");
}

int len = lang.Length;
Console.WriteLine($"The string has {len} characters");
```

In this program, we demonstrate that strings are objects. Objects must  
have a class name, a parent class and they must also have some methods  
that we can call or properties to access.

An object of `System.String` type is created.

```csharp
string lang = "Java";
```

We determine the class name of the object to which the `lang` variable  
refers.

```csharp
string bclass = lang.GetType().Name;
Console.WriteLine(bclass);
```

A parent class of our object is received. All objects have at least one  
parent — the `Object`.

```csharp
string parclass = lang.GetType().BaseType!.Name;
Console.WriteLine(parclass);
```

Objects have various methods. With the `Equals` method we check if the  
string is empty.

```csharp
if (lang.Equals(string.Empty))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The string is empty");
} else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The string is not empty");
}
```

The `Length` property returns the size of the string.

```csharp
int len = lang.Length;
Console.WriteLine($"The string has {len} characters");
```

```
$ dotnet run
String
Object
The string is not empty
The string has 4 characters
```

## C# mutable & immutable strings

The `String` is a sequence of immutable characters, while the  
`StringBuilder` is a sequence of mutable characters. The next example  
shows the difference.



```csharp
using System.Text;

string name = "Jane";
string name2 = name.Replace('J', 'K');
string name3 = name2.Replace('n', 't');

Console.WriteLine(name);
Console.WriteLine(name3);

var sb = new StringBuilder("Jane");
Console.WriteLine(sb);

sb.Replace('J', 'K', 0, 1);
sb.Replace('n', 't', 2, 1);

Console.WriteLine(sb);
```

Both objects have methods for replacing characters in a string.

Calling `Replace` method on a string results in returning a new modified  
string. The original string is not changed.

```csharp
string name = "Jane";
string name2 = name.Replace('J', 'K');
string name3 = name2.Replace('n', 't');
```

The `Replace` method of a `StringBuilder` replaces a character at the  
given index with a new character. The original string is modified.

```csharp
sb.Replace('J', 'K', 0, 1);
sb.Replace('n', 't', 2, 1);
```

```
$ dotnet run
Jane
Kate
Jane
Kate
```

## C# string concatenation

Immutable strings can be added using the + operator or the `Concat`  
method. They form a new string which is a chain of all concatenated  
strings. Mutable strings have the `Append` method which builds a string  
from any number of other strings.

It is also possible to concatenate strings using string formatting and  
interpolation.



```csharp
using System.Text;

Console.WriteLine("Return" + " of " + "the king.");
Console.WriteLine(string.Concat(string.Concat("Return", " of "), "the king."));

var sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append("Return");
sb.Append(" of ");
sb.Append("the king.");

Console.WriteLine(sb);

string s1 = "Return";
string s2 = "of";
string s3 = "the king.";

Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}", s1, s2, s3);
Console.WriteLine($"{s1} {s2} {s3}");
```

The example creates five sentences by concatenating strings.

A new string is formed by using the + operator.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Return" + " of " + "the king.");
```

The `Concat` method concatenates two strings. The method is a static  
method of the `System.String` class.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(string.Concat(string.Concat("Return", " of "), "the king."));
```

A mutable object of the `StringBuilder` type is created by calling the  
`Append` method three times.

```csharp
var sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.Append("Return");
sb.Append(" of ");
sb.Append("the king.");
```

A string is formed with string formatting.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}", s1, s2, s3);
```

Finally, the strings are added with the interpolation syntax.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"{s1} {s2} {s3}");
```

```
$ dotnet run
Return of the king.
Return of the king.
Return of the king.
Return of the king.
Return of the king.
```

## C# using quotes

When we want to display quotes, for instance in direct speech, the inner  
quotes must be escaped.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine("There are many stars.");
Console.WriteLine("He said, \"Which one is your favourite?\"");

Console.WriteLine(@"
Lao Tzu has said:
""If you do not change direction, you may end up
where you are heading.""
.");
```

This example prints direct speech.

Inside a regular string, the character is escaped with `\`.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("He said, \"Which one is your favourite?\"");
```

Inside a verbatim string, the quote is preceded with another quote.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(@"
Lao Tzu has said:
""If you do not change direction, you may end up
where you are heading.""
.");
```

```
$ dotnet run
There are many stars.
He said, "Which one is your favourite?"

Lao Tzu has said:
"If you do not change direction, you may end up
where you are heading."
```

## C# comparing strings

We can compare two strings with the `==` operator.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine("12" == "12");
Console.WriteLine("17" == "9");
Console.WriteLine("aa" == "ab");
```

In the example program, we compare strings.

```
$ dotnet run
True
False
False
```

The `string.Compare` method compares two specified strings and returns an  
integer that indicates their relative position in the sort order. If the  
returned value is less than zero, the first string is less than the  
second. If it returns zero, both strings are equal. Finally, if the  
returned value is greater than zero, the first string is greater than  
the second.



```csharp
string str1 = "ZetCode";
string str2 = "zetcode";

Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(str1, str2, true));
Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(str1, str2, false));
```

There is an optional third `ignoreCase` argument. It determines if the  
case should be honored or not.

Compare two strings and ignore the case. This line prints 0 to the  
console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(str1, str2, true));
```

## C# string elements

A string is a sequence of characters. A character is a basic element of  
a string.



```csharp
char[] crs = ['Z', 'e', 't', 'C', 'o', 'd', 'e'];
string s = new(crs);

char c1 = s[0];
char c2 = s[^1];

Console.WriteLine(c1);
Console.WriteLine(c2);

int i1 = s.IndexOf('e');
int i2 = s.LastIndexOf('e');

Console.WriteLine("The first index of character e is " + i1);
Console.WriteLine("The last index of character e is " + i2);

Console.WriteLine(s.Contains('t'));
Console.WriteLine(s.Contains('f'));

char[] elements = s.ToCharArray();

foreach (char e in elements)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e);
}
```

In the first example, we work with an immutable string.

A new immutable string is formed from an array of characters.

```csharp
char[] crs = ['Z', 'e', 't', 'C', 'o', 'd', 'e'];
string s = new(crs);
```

Using the array access notation, we get the first and the last char value  
of the string.

```csharp
char c1 = s[0];
char c2 = s[^1];
```

With the above methods, we get the first and the last occurrence of the  
character 'e'.

```csharp
int i1 = s.IndexOf('e');
int i2 = s.LastIndexOf('e');
```

With the `Contains` method we check if the string contains the 't'  
character. The method returns a boolean value.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(s.Contains('t'));
Console.WriteLine(s.Contains('f'));
```

The `ToCharArray` method creates a character array from the string. We go  
through the array and print each of the characters.

```csharp
char[] elements = s.ToCharArray();

foreach (char e in elements)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e);
}
```

```
$ dotnet run
Z
e
The first index of character e is 1
The last index of character e is 6
True
False
Z
e
t
C
o
d
e
```

In the second example, we work with the elements of a mutable string.



```csharp
using System.Text;

var sb = new StringBuilder("Misty mountains");
Console.WriteLine(sb);

sb.Remove(sb.Length-1, 1);
Console.WriteLine(sb);

sb.Append('s');
Console.WriteLine(sb);

sb.Insert(0, 'T');
sb.Insert(1, 'h');
sb.Insert(2, 'e');
sb.Insert(3, ' ');
Console.WriteLine(sb);

sb.Replace('M', 'm', 4, 1);
Console.WriteLine(sb);
```

A mutable string is formed. We modify the contents of the string by  
deleting, appending, inserting, and replacing characters.

This line deletes the last character.

```csharp
sb.Remove(sb.Length-1, 1);
```

The deleted character is appended back to the string.

```csharp
sb.Append('s');
```

We insert four characters at the beginning of the string.

```csharp
sb.Insert(0, 'T');
sb.Insert(1, 'h');
sb.Insert(2, 'e');
sb.Insert(3, ' ');
```

Finally, we replace a character at index 4.

```csharp
sb.Replace('M', 'm', 4, 1);
```

```
$ dotnet run
Misty mountains
Misty mountain
Misty mountains
The Misty mountains
The misty mountains
```

## C# string Join and Split

The `Join` joins strings and the `Split` splits the strings.



```csharp
string[] items = ["C#", "Visual Basic", "Java", "Perl"];

var langs = string.Join(",", items);
Console.WriteLine(langs);

string[] langs2 = langs.Split(',');

foreach (string lang in langs2)
{
    Console.WriteLine(lang);
}
```

In the program we join and split strings.

This is an array of strings. These strings are going to be joined.

```csharp
string[] items = ["C#", "Visual Basic", "Java", "Perl"];
```

All words from the array are joined. We build one string from them. There  
will be a comma character between each two words.

```csharp
string langs = string.Join(",", items);
```

As a reverse operation, we split the langs string. The `Split` method  
returns an array of words, delimited by a character. In our case it is a  
comma character.

```csharp
string[] langs2 = langs.Split(',');
```

We go through the array and print its elements.

```csharp
foreach (string lang in langs2)
{
    Console.WriteLine(lang);
}
```

```
$ dotnet run
C#,Visual Basic,Java,Perl
C#
Visual Basic
Java
Perl
```

## C# string StartsWith

The `StartsWith` method determines whether this string instance starts  
with the specified character.



```csharp
var words = "club\nsky\nblue\ncup\ncoin\nnew\ncent\nowl\nfalcon\nwar\nice";

using var sr = new StringReader(words);

string? line;

while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null)
{
    if (line.StartsWith('c')) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
    }
}
```

We have a couple of words in a string. We print all words that start with  
letter c.

```
$ dotnet run
club
cup
coin
cent
```

## C# string EndsWith

The `EndsWith` determines whether the end of this string instance matches  
a specified string.



```csharp
var words = "club\nsky\nblue\ncup\ncoin\nnew\ncent\nowl\nfalcon\nwar\nice";

using var sr = new StringReader(words);

string? line;

while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null)
{
    if (line.EndsWith('y') || line.EndsWith('n')) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
    }
}
```

In the example, we print all words that end either with n or y.

```
$ dotnet run
sky
coin
falcon
```

## C# string ToUpper/ToLower

The `ToUpper` method converts all of the characters of the string to  
upper case. The `ToLower` method converts all of the characters of the  
string to lower case.



```csharp
var word1 = "Cherry";

var u_word1 = word1.ToUpper();
var l_word1 = u_word1.ToLower();

Console.WriteLine(u_word1);
Console.WriteLine(l_word1);

var word2 = "Čerešňa";

var u_word2 = word2.ToUpper();
var l_word2 = u_word2.ToLower();

Console.WriteLine(u_word2);
Console.WriteLine(l_word2);
```

We modify the case of two words.

```
$ dotnet run
CHERRY
cherry
ČEREŠŇA
čerešňa
```

## Working with C# Runes

The `EnumerateRunes` method in C# allows you to iterate over individual  
Unicode characters, or "runes," within a string. A rune is represented  
by the `System.Text.Rune` type, which corresponds to a single Unicode  
scalar value, enabling efficient handling of text containing characters  
from diverse alphabets, symbols, or emojis.



```csharp
var text = "🐄🦙🐘🐫🐑🦝🦍🐯";
var runes = text.EnumerateRunes();

foreach (var rune in runes) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(rune);
}
```

In this example, we use the `EnumerateRunes` method to iterate over a  
sequence of emojis. This approach ensures that multi-byte Unicode  
characters are accurately processed, preserving their integrity and  
proper representation.

```
$ dotnet run
🐄
🦙
🐘
🐫
🐑
🦝
🦍
🐯
```

## C# string Remove

The `Remove` method returns a new string in which a specified number of  
characters from the current string are deleted.



```csharp
var text = "Did you go there? We did, but we had a \"great\" service there.";

string[] parts = text.Split(" ");

foreach (var part in parts)
{
    var word = removeChars(part);
    Console.WriteLine(word);
}

string removeChars(string part)
{
    var word = part;

    if (part.EndsWith('.') || part.EndsWith('?') || 
        part.EndsWith(',') || part.EndsWith('\"'))
    {
        word = part.Remove(part.Length - 1, 1);
    }

    if (word.StartsWith('\"'))
    {
        word = word.Remove(0, 1);
    }

    return word;
}
```

The example splits a string into words and removes potential commas, dots,  
question marks, or double quotation marks.

If the current word ends with any of the characters, we remove it with  
`Remove`.

```csharp
if (part.EndsWith('.') || part.EndsWith('?') || 
    part.EndsWith(',') || part.EndsWith('\"'))
{
    word = part.Remove(part.Length - 1, 1);
}
```

Also, we remove the double quote character if it precedes the string.

```csharp
if (word.StartsWith('\"'))
{
    word = word.Remove(0, 1);
}
```

```
$ dotnet run
Did
you
go
there
We
did
but
we
had
a
great
service
there
```

## C# Substring

The `Substring` method retrieves a substring from a string.



```csharp
var word = "bookcase";

Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(0, 4));
Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(4, 4));
Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(4));
```

The example uses the substring method to create two substrings.

We get the first word from the string. The first paramenter is the  
starting index and the second is the length of the substring.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(0, 4));
```

We get the second word.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(4, 4));
```

This overloaded method starts from the specified index and continues to  
the end of the string.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(word.Substring(4));
```

```
$ dotnet run
book
case
case
```

## C# string Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters  
which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar.  
There are many ways to check if a string is a palindrome. The following  
example is one of the possible solutions.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine(isPalindrome("radar"));
Console.WriteLine(isPalindrome("kayak"));
Console.WriteLine(isPalindrome("forest"));

bool isPalindrome(string original)
{
    char[] data = original.ToCharArray();

    int i = 0;
    int j = data.Length - 1;

    while (j > i)
    {

        if (data[i] != data[j])
        {
            return false;
        }

        i++;
        j--;
    }

    return true;
}
```

We have an implementation of the isPalindrome method.

We turn the string into a array of characters.

```csharp
char[] data = original.ToCharArray();
```

We iterate through the array and compare the left side characters with  
the right side corresponding characters. If all match, we return true,  
otherwise we return false.

```csharp
int i = 0;
int j = data.Length - 1;

while (j > i)
{
    if (data[i] != data[j])
    {
        return false;
    }

    i++;
    j--;
}

return true;
```

```
$ dotnet run
True
True
False
```

## C# string Copy vs Clone

We describe a difference between two methods: `Copy` and `Clone`. The  
`Copy` method creates a new instance of string with the same value as a  
specified string. The `Clone` method returns a reference to the string  
which is being cloned. It is not an independent copy of the string on  
the Heap. It is another reference on the same string.



```csharp
string str = "ZetCode";

string cloned = (string) str.Clone();
string copied = string.Copy(str);

Console.WriteLine(str.Equals(cloned)); // prints True
Console.WriteLine(str.Equals(copied)); // prints True

Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(str, cloned)); // prints True
Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(str, copied)); // prints False
```

Our example demonstrates the difference between the two methods.

The string value is cloned and copied.

```csharp
string cloned = (string) str.Clone();
string copied = string.Copy(str);
```

The `Equals` method determines whether two string objects have the same  
value. The contents of all three strings are the same.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(str.Equals(cloned)); // prints True
Console.WriteLine(str.Equals(copied)); // prints True
```

The `ReferenceEquals` method compares the two reference objects.  
Therefore comparing a copied string to the original string returns false.  
Because they are two distinct objects.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(str, cloned)); // prints True
Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(str, copied)); // prints False
```

## C# string format

In the next examples, we format strings. More in-depth coverage is  
presented in [C# String Format](/csharp/stringformat) article.

The .NET platform has a feature called *composite formatting*. It is  
supported by `Format` and `WriteLine` methods. A method takes a list of  
objects and a composite format string as input. The format string  
consists of fixed string and some format items. These format items are  
indexed placeholders which correspond to the objects in the list.

The format item has the following syntax:

```
{index[,length][:formatString]}
```

The index component is mandatory. It is a number starting from 0 that  
refers to an item from the list of objects. Multiple items can refer to  
the same element of the list of objects. An object is ignored if it is  
not referenced by a format item. If we refer outside the bounds of the  
list of objects, a runtime exception is thrown.

The length component is optional. It is the minimum number of characters  
in the string representation of the parameter. If positive, the parameter  
is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned. If it is specified,  
there must by a colon separating the index and the length.

The formatString is optional. It is a string that formats a value is a  
specific way. It can be used to format dates, times, numbers or  
enumerations.



```csharp
int oranges = 2;
int apples = 4;
int bananas = 3;

string str1 = "There are {0} oranges, {1} apples and {2} bananas";
string str2 = "There are {1} oranges, {2} bananas and {0} apples";

Console.WriteLine(str1, oranges, apples, bananas);
Console.WriteLine(str2, apples, oranges, bananas);
```

We print a simple message to the console. We use only index component of  
the format item.

The `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}` are format items. We specify the index  
component. Other components are optional.

```csharp
string str1 = "There are {0} oranges, {1} apples and {2} bananas";
```

Now we put together the composite formatting. We have the string and the  
list of objects (oranges, apples, bananas). The `{0}` format item refers  
to the oranges. The `WriteLine` method replaces the `{0}` format item  
with the contents of the oranges variable.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(str1, oranges, apples, bananas);
```

The order of the format items referring to the objects is notation  
important.

```csharp
string str2 = "There are {1} oranges, {2} bananas and {0} apples";
```

```
$ dotnet run
There are 2 oranges, 4 apples and 3 bananas
There are 2 oranges, 3 bananas and 4 apples
```

The next example formats numeric data.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine("{0}  {1, 12}", "Decimal", "Hexadecimal");

Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 502, 546);
Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 345, 765);
Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 320, 654);
Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 120, 834);
Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 620, 454);
```

We print numbers in a decimal and hexadecimal format. We also align the  
numbers using the length component.

The `{0:D}` format item specifies, the first item from the list of  
supplied objects will be taken and formatted in the decimal format. The  
`{1,8:X}` format item takes the second item. Formats it in the  
hexadecimal format `:X`. And the string length will be 8 characters `8 `.  
Because the number has only three characters, it is right aligned and  
padded with empty strings.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("{0:D}  {1,8:X}", 502, 546);
```

```
$ dotnet run
Decimal   Hexadecimal
502       222
345       2FD
320       28E
120       342
620       1C6
```

The last two examples format numeric and date data.



```csharp
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Number: {0:N}", 126));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Scientific: {0:E}", 126));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Currency: {0:C}", 126));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Percent: {0:P}", 126));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Hexadecimal: {0:X}", 126));
```

The example demonstrates the standard formatting specifiers for numbers.  
Number 126 is printed in five different formats: normal, scientific,  
currency, percent and hexadecimal.

```
$ dotnet run
Number: 126.00
Scientific: 1.260000E+002
Currency: $126.00
Percent: 12,600.00%
Hexadecimal: 7E
```

Finally, we format date and time data.



```csharp
DateTime today = DateTime.Now;

Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Short date: {0:d}", today));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Long date: {0:D}", today));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Short time: {0:t}", today));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Long time: {0:T}", today));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Month: {0:M}", today));
Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Year: {0:Y}", today));
```

The code example shows six various formats for current date and time.

```
$ dotnet run
Short date: 5/1/2025
Long date: Thursday, May 1, 2025
Short time: 5:13 PM
Long time: 5:13:30 PM
Month: May 1
Year: May 2025
```

## Trimming whitespace

The `Trim`, `TrimStart`, and `TrimEnd` methods are used to remove  
whitespace characters from the beginning and/or end of a string. The  
`Trim` method removes whitespace from both ends, while `TrimStart`  
removes whitespace from the beginning and `TrimEnd` removes whitespace  
from the end. These methods return a new string with the specified  
characters removed, leaving the original string unchanged.



```csharp
string input = "   hello there   ";

Console.WriteLine($"Original: '{input}'");
Console.WriteLine($"Trim: '{input.Trim()}'");
Console.WriteLine($"TrimStart: '{input.TrimStart()}'");
Console.WriteLine($"TrimEnd: '{input.TrimEnd()}'");
```

This example shows how to remove whitespace from the beginning and/or end  
of a string using `Trim`, `TrimStart`, and `TrimEnd`.

## String comparison with culture and case sensitivity

The `String.Compare` method is used to compare two strings with different  
`StringComparison` options. The `StringComparison` enum provides options  
for culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons. The  
`StringComparison.Ordinal` option performs a case-sensitive ordinal  
comparison, while `StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase` performs  
a case-insensitive comparison using the invariant culture.

This is useful for comparing strings in a way that is not affected by the  
current culture settings of the system. The `String.Compare` method  
returns an integer indicating the relative position of the two strings in  
the sort order. A negative value indicates that the first string precedes  
the second string, zero indicates that they are equal, and a positive  
value indicates that the first string follows the second string.



```csharp
string a = "straße";
string b = "STRASSE";

Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(a, b, StringComparison.Ordinal));
Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(a, b, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase));
```

This example demonstrates comparing strings with different  
`StringComparison` options, showing the effect of culture and case  
sensitivity.

## Replace and remove substrings

The `Replace` method is used to replace all occurrences of a specified  
substring with another substring in a string. The `Remove` method is used  
to remove a specified number of characters from a string, starting at a  
specified index. Both methods return a new string with the modifications  
applied, leaving the original string unchanged.

The `Replace` method is useful for changing specific parts of a string,  
while the `Remove` method is useful for deleting unwanted characters or  
substrings. The `Remove` method takes two parameters: the starting index  
and the number of characters to remove. The `Replace` method takes two  
parameters: the substring to replace and the new substring to insert.  
Both methods return a new string with the specified modifications,  
leaving the original string unchanged.



```csharp
string text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
string replaced = text.Replace("fox", "cat");
string removed = text.Remove(16, 4); // removes 'fox '

Console.WriteLine(replaced);
Console.WriteLine(removed);
```

This example shows how to replace a substring and remove a portion of a  
string by index and length.

## PadLeft and PadRight for formatting

The `PadLeft` and `PadRight` methods are used to pad a string with a  
specified character to the left or right, respectively. The `PadLeft`  
method adds padding characters to the left side of the string until it  
reaches a specified total width, while the `PadRight` method adds padding  
characters to the right side of the string.

Both methods return a new string with the padding applied, leaving the  
original string unchanged. The padding character can be specified as an  
argument, and the total width can be specified as well. If the original  
string is already equal to or greater than the specified width, no  
padding is added. These methods are useful for formatting strings for  
display, such as aligning text in a table or ensuring consistent widths  
for output.



```csharp
string word = "42";

Console.WriteLine(word.PadLeft(5, '0'));
Console.WriteLine(word.PadRight(8, '-'));
```

This example demonstrates how to align or pad strings using `PadLeft` and  
`PadRight`.

## Efficient string search with IndexOf and LastIndexOf

The `IndexOf` and `LastIndexOf` methods are used to find the position of  
a specified character or substring within a string. The `IndexOf` method  
returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified  
character or substring, while the `LastIndexOf` method returns the  
zero-based index of the last occurrence. If the specified character or  
substring is not found, both methods return -1.

These methods are useful for searching for specific characters or  
substrings within a larger string, allowing you to determine the position  
of the first or last occurrence. The search is case-sensitive by default,  
but you can specify a `StringComparison` option to control the case  
sensitivity of the search. The `IndexOf` and `LastIndexOf` methods can  
also take additional parameters to specify the starting index and the  
number of characters to search within.



```csharp
string phrase = "abracadabra";
int first = phrase.IndexOf('a');
int last = phrase.LastIndexOf('a');

Console.WriteLine($"First 'a': {first}");
Console.WriteLine($"Last 'a': {last}");
```

This example uses `IndexOf` and `LastIndexOf` to find the position of  
characters in a string.

In this article, we explored the fundamentals of C# strings, including  
their definition, key classes, and practical usage. By understanding how  
strings function in C#, you can effectively handle and manipulate text  
in your applications, whether you're working with immutable objects or  
dynamic string builders.
