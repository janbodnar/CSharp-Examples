# C# record

*last modified July 5, 2023*

C# record tutorial shows how to work with the record type in C#.  

A record is a reference type whose main purpose is to hold data. It is very  
useful for data analysis. The record type simplifies code and improves its  
readability, and removes unnecessary boilerplate.  

The record type provides the following features:  

- concise syntax for data-centric objects
- concise syntax for immutable data
- value-based equality
- concise syntax for non-destructive mutation
- built-in formattting for printing

The compiler creates an override of `Object.Equals(Object)` and  
`Object.GetHashCode`. It creates methods for `==` and `!=` operators and  
implements the `System.IEquatable<T>`. Records also provide an override of   
`Object.ToString`.  

While records share a lot of similarities with standard classes, they have  
different purposes. Classes are used for defining complex hierarchies of objects  
and their responsitilities, records excel in storing data for the purpose of   
their analysis.  

**Note:** The record type is an important part of the functional programming  
philosophy. It is a very useful tool for data analysis.  

Important functional languages, such as F# and Clojure, have record types since  
their inception. The record type appeared in C# 9.0.  

## C# record positional syntax

To easiest way to create a record is to use the *positional syntax*.  

```csharp
record User(string FirstName, string LastName, string occupation);
```

Using this syntax, the compiler automatically creates the following:  

- a public init-only auto-implemented property for each positional parameter  
  provided in the record declaration.
- a primary constructor whose parameters match the positional parameters on  
  the record declaration
- a `Deconstruct` method with an out parameter for each positional parameter  
  provided in the record declaration

The data created with positional syntax is immutable. Data immutability is an  
important cornerstone of functional programming.  

## C# record simple examples

In the following example, we create a simple record type.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var users = new List<User>
{
    new ("John", "Doe", 1230),
    new ("Lucy", "Novak", 670),
    new ("Ben", "Walter", 2050),
    new ("Robin", "Brown", 2300),
    new ("Amy", "Doe", 1250),
    new ("Joe", "Draker", 1190),
    new ("Janet", "Doe", 980),
    new ("Albert", "Novak", 1930),
};

users.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);

Console.WriteLine(users[0].FirstName);
Console.WriteLine(users[0].LastName);
Console.WriteLine(users[0].Salary);

record User(string FirstName, string LastName, int Salary);
```

We create a `User` record in one line; we are ready to use it.  

```csharp
users.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
```

We traverse the list of users and print them to the console. Thanks to the  
built-in formatting of records, we have a human-readable output for the records.  

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(users[0].FirstName);
Console.WriteLine(users[0].LastName);
Console.WriteLine(users[0].Salary);
```

The properties are automatically created.  

```
$ dotner run
User { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1230 }
User { FirstName = Lucy, LastName = Novak, Salary = 670 }
User { FirstName = Ben, LastName = Walter, Salary = 2050 }
User { FirstName = Robin, LastName = Brown, Salary = 2300 }
User { FirstName = Amy, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1250 }
User { FirstName = Joe, LastName = Draker, Salary = 1190 }
User { FirstName = Janet, LastName = Doe, Salary = 980 }
User { FirstName = Albert, LastName = Novak, Salary = 1930 }
John
Doe
1230
```

In the second example, we use a record type with LINQ.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var cars = new List<Car>
{
    new ("Audi", "red", 52642),
    new ("Mercedes", "blue", 57127),
    new ("Skoda", "black", 9000),
    new ("Volvo", "red", 29000),
    new ("Bentley", "yellow", 350000),
    new ("Citroen", "white", 21000),
    new ("Hummer", "black", 41400),
    new ("Volkswagen", "white", 21600),
};

var groups = from car in cars
             group car by car.Colour;

foreach (var group in groups)
{
    Console.WriteLine(group.Key);

    foreach (var car in group)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($" {car.Name} {car.Price}");
    }
}

record Car(string Name, string Colour, int Price);
```

We use LINQ expression to group our cars by their colours. Again, we have  
defined the record type in one line. We focus on the data analysis and not on  
complex OOP techniques.  

```
$ dotnet run
red
  Audi 52642
  Volvo 29000
blue
  Mercedes 57127
black
  Skoda 9000
  Hummer 41400
yellow
  Bentley 350000
white
  Citroen 21000
  Volkswagen 21600
```

## C# record equality

Records provide value-based equality. When we focus on data analysis, this is  
the expected behaviour. Classes on the other hand provide reference equality  
by default. To have value-based equality with classes, we have to add additional  
lines of code to the class definitions, which is often done with IDE generators  
and is considered boilerplate.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var u1 = new User("John", "Doe", "gardener");
var u2 = new User("John", "Doe", "gardener");

Console.WriteLine(u1 == u2);

var p1 = new Person("Roger", "Roe", "driver");
var p2 = new Person("Roger", "Roe", "driver");

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2);

record User(string FirstName, string LastName, string occupation);

class Person
{
    public Person(string firstName, string lastName, string occupation)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        Occupation = occupation;
    }

    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Occupation { get; set; }
}
```

In the example, we compare two records and two class objects having the same  
data.  

```
$ dotnet run
True
False
```

The records compare values while the class objects references. The second output  
is False because `p1` and `p2` point to two different objects in memory.  

## C# record Deconstruct

With the positional syntax, we have the `Deconstruct` method automatically  
implemented.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var u = new User("John", "Doe", 980);

(string fname, string lname, int sal) = u;

Console.WriteLine($"{fname} {lname} earns {sal} per month");

record User(string FirstName, string LastName, int Salary);
```

A record's properties can be easily separated into variables with deconstrution  
operation.  

```
$ dotnet run
John Doe earns 980 per month
```


## C# record non-destructive mutation

In functional programming, we work with immutable data. When we need to modify  
data, we create modified copies of the original data, which is intact.  
This simple rule brings huge benefits in concurrent programming.  

We can use the `with` keyword to get modified copies of our records.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var users = new List<User>
{
    new ("John", "Doe", 1230),
    new ("Lucy", "Novak", 670),
    new ("Ben", "Walter", 2050),
    new ("Robin", "Brown", 2300),
    new ("Amy", "Doe", 1250),
    new ("Joe", "Draker", 1190),
    new ("Janet", "Doe", 980),
    new ("Albert", "Novak", 1930),
};

var users2 = new List<User>();
users.ForEach(u => users2.Add(u with { Salary = u.Salary + 200 }));

users.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);

Console.WriteLine("---------------");

users2.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);

record User(string FirstName, string LastName, int Salary);
```

In the example, we have a list of users. We want to add a bonus to each user.  
Rather than modifying the original list, we create a new one with their salaries  
modified.  

```
$ dotnet run
User { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1230 }
User { FirstName = Lucy, LastName = Novak, Salary = 670 }
User { FirstName = Ben, LastName = Walter, Salary = 2050 }
User { FirstName = Robin, LastName = Brown, Salary = 2300 }
User { FirstName = Amy, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1250 }
User { FirstName = Joe, LastName = Draker, Salary = 1190 }
User { FirstName = Janet, LastName = Doe, Salary = 980 }
User { FirstName = Albert, LastName = Novak, Salary = 1930 }
---------------
User { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1430 }
User { FirstName = Lucy, LastName = Novak, Salary = 870 }
User { FirstName = Ben, LastName = Walter, Salary = 2250 }
User { FirstName = Robin, LastName = Brown, Salary = 2500 }
User { FirstName = Amy, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1450 }
User { FirstName = Joe, LastName = Draker, Salary = 1390 }
User { FirstName = Janet, LastName = Doe, Salary = 1180 }
User { FirstName = Albert, LastName = Novak, Salary = 2130 }
```


## C# mutable record

It is possible to create a mutable record. However, when possible, the usage of  
immutable records is preferred.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
var u = new User("John", "Doe", "gardener");
Console.WriteLine(u);

u.Occupation = "driver";
Console.WriteLine(u);

record User
{
    public User(string firstName, string lastName, string occupation)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        Occupation = occupation;
    }
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = default!;
    public string LastName { get; set; } = default!;
    public string Occupation { get; set; } = default!;
};
```

By implementing our own properties, we have a mutable record.  

```
$ dotnet run
User { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Occupation = gardener }
User { FirstName = John, LastName = Doe, Occupation = driver }
```


## Web scraping example

To demonstrate the usefulness of records, we have a more complex example which  
scrapes data from a website.  

```
$ dotnet add package AngleSharp
$ dotnet add package CsvHelper
```

We need to add the `AngleSharp` and `CsvHelper` packages to the project.  

**Program.cs**

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using AngleSharp;
using CsvHelper;

var config = Configuration.Default.WithDefaultLoader();
using var context = BrowsingContext.New(config);

var url = "https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2019";
using var doc = await context.OpenAsync(url);

var htable = doc.GetElementById("stores-list--section-16266");
var trs = htable.QuerySelectorAll("tr").Skip(1);

var csvConfig = new CsvHelper.Configuration.CsvConfiguration(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture)
{
    ShouldQuote = args => false
};

using var fs = new StreamWriter("data.csv");
using var writer = new CsvWriter(fs, csvConfig);

var rows = new List<Row>();

foreach (var tr in trs)
{
    var tds = tr.QuerySelectorAll("td").Take(3);
    var fields = (from e in tds select e.TextContent).ToArray();
    var row = new Row(fields[0], fields[1], fields[2]);

    rows.Add(row);
}

writer.WriteRecords(rows);

record Row(string Rank, string Company, string Sales);
```

In the example, we scrape data from a website. In the HTML table, there are  
100 top retailers in the US. We connect to the website, parse the HTML table,  
and pick three of its columns. The parsed data is saved into a CSV file.  
The example creates the `Row` record, which stores one row of the parsed data.  

In this article we have covered C# record type.
